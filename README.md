# Multi-Linear-Regression-1-Assignment
# Introduction

Multi Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this project, we will be performing Multi Linear Regression on the 50_Startups.csv dataset to analyze the relationship between a startup's profit and its spending on R&D, administration, and marketing.

# Data Description

The 50_Startups.csv dataset contains five columns - "R&D Spend", "Administration", "Marketing Spend", "State", and "Profit". "R&D Spend", "Administration", and "Marketing Spend" represent the spending on research and development, administration, and marketing respectively. "State" represents the state in which the startup operates, and "Profit" represents the corresponding profit of that startup.

# Methodology

We will be using Multi Linear Regression to model the relationship between "R&D Spend", "Administration", "Marketing Spend" and "Profit". Multi Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. We will first visualize the relationship between the variables using a scatter plot matrix. Then we will fit a linear regression model and check its accuracy using the R-squared value. Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Results

Our analysis showed a positive linear relationship between a startup's spending on R&D, administration, marketing and its profit. The scatter plot matrix showed a clear trend, with the profit increasing as the spending on R&D, administration, and marketing increased.

The linear regression model had an R-squared value of 0.9507, indicating a strong correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This means that 95.07% of the variation in profit can be explained by the variation in spending on R&D, administration, and marketing.

Using the linear regression model, we can make predictions on the profit of a startup given its spending on R&D, administration, and marketing.

# Conclusion

Multi Linear Regression is a powerful tool for modeling the relationship between multiple variables. In this project, we used Multi Linear Regression to model the relationship between a startup's spending on R&D, administration, marketing and its profit. Our analysis showed a strong positive linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, with the profit increasing as the spending on R&D, administration, and marketing increased.

This model can be used by startups to optimize their spending on R&D, administration, and marketing and estimate their profit. It can also be used by investors to evaluate and compare the profitability of different startups.
